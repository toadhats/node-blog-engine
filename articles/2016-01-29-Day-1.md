Got the project in my inbox this morning. Today was about walking and thinking, and looking at the countless existing blog engines to discover the general patterns and best practices. Serendipitously, I'd been working on a new blog of my own using Hugo, so I'd at least gotten a grip on what is expected of a "blog engine"; the features, workflows, and so on. I noticed that the markdown files provided by Auth0 begin with metadata, just like how it works with Hugo â€” so I'm going to have to process the files in a similar way.

I still have a little way to go in terms of learning/refreshing myself on the frameworks I'll need for this project. I'm hoping I'll be allowed to use express.js, as its one I've been wanting to try for a while, but haven't had a chance yet. Just waiting to hear back from the company, I don't want to look like I'm making things too easy.

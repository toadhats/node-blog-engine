So far I've still mainly been working out how to approach the task. What I'm going to end up with is probably going to be a rudimentary Node.js imitation of Hugo -- working with simple markdown files for articles and serving them up according to a specified theme. I'm kind of using it as my target in terms of functionality and UX, but I'm studiously refraining from actually reading the source for ideas as to how they do specific things -- not that reading source in Go would substantially help me write in Node (especially since I don't know Go).

I haven't heard back yet re: using Express but I'm just going to go for it as I'm eager to get to coding. My first 'milestone' to aim for is getting the framework up and running, serving up the skeleton of what will become the index or article list. I might also take the time at this stage to see how I can apply the Auth0 CSS to the generated page -- if it looks like it might be too difficult then I'll set it aside, but if I can get it working I feel like it will add a lot of polish with fairly minimal effort on my part. I still have some learning to do though -- mainly Jade at this stage, as I'm still not 100% getting how it applies styles, and I need a bit more practice before I'd be fully comfortable passing text dynamically into the templates -- javascript strings work, but is there a better way?

Following last month's [new pricing announcement](https://auth0.com/pricing) and new free and full-featured [developer plan](https://auth0.com/signup), today we are adding a **Startup Plan** to our pricing. 

### Startup Plan

The deal is very simple, if you meet the three conditions below:

- less than $1M in Annual Recurring Revenue (ARR)
- less than $2M in raised funding
- less than 2 years old

you get unrestricted usage of Auth0 for 1 year for $99 per month.

It's that simple.

Email [startup@auth0.com](mailto:startup@auth0.com) for requesting your Startup plan.

This is the first test post, while I'm working out how to quickly create article templates, et cetera. The current front matter format is working fine, now we can turn it into a snippet to save time. I've decided to host the 'devblog' I wrote while developing this app, since I wanted to remove the articles belonging to Auth0, and needed a few test articles to replace them â€“ why use dummy articles when I already wrote a bunch?

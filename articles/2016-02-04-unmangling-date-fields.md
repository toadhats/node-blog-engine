title: Unmangling the date fields
description: In which we discover more inconsistencies in the test articles I was given, and agonise whether to adapt to the existing content, or declare it incompatible with my grand vision and twist it until it fits.

Since the async readFile calls meant the articles were being stored in memory in the wrong order, I knew I'd have to sort them for display. Because the files are presumably able to be processed by Jekyll as-is, I had hoped I'd get away with just sorting them as strings (which I incorrectly assumed would work for YYYY-MM-DD order), but that's not the case. Partly because I was wrong (the time components wouldn't sort properly), and secondly because the date attributes aren't consistent. Some are in quotes, some aren't; at least one article is in 12hr time while the rest are in 24hr; and some values have leading zeroes while others don't. I think I'm going to need to carefully create my own date processing function to catch all the edge cases and turn all the dates into consistent javascript Date types before I can correctly sort them â€“ this will also allow me to ensure that they're all displayed consistently.

**Update:** Looks like moment.js should be able to fix this for me easily. Fingers crossed.

**Another update:** Moment.js is magic. It must be what is being used behind the scenes on the actual Auth0 blog server, because it handles all the inconsistent formats just fine.

Spent the last couple of days dipping back into hard CS topics to figure out how I should begin implementing tag cloud functionality - I had a strong feeling that doing this without core principles in mind would lead to a performance nightmare. In the end, after cooking up various approaches on my own and then agonising over the relative computational complexity involved, I've concluded that the best approach is to just use Lazy.js:
- It's slower than native JavaScript for loops, but it's faster than all the other methods - and it scales well, apparently.
- It's like a million times easier to read
- I will be able to implement the feature in like a couple of hours, instead of a couple of days.

I don't feel the time I spent working on my own algorithms from first principles was wasted - for one, now I genuinely understand why I've chosen to discard those approaches in favour of using Lazy, and secondly, the whole process has significantly improved my understanding of computational complexity and big O notation - so not only do I understand what I've decided to do, but I'm better able to convey that understanding on paper/whiteboard.

We are very excited to announce [Auth0 (AuthZero)](https://auth0.com).

Auth0 is identity management that __"just works"__. It's about removing the pain of developing, deploying, troubleshooting and operating a modern, advanced identity management system.

Auth0 allows developers to easily connect their apps with common enterprise identity providers: Office365, Google Apps, Active Directory, OpenLDAP, SQL databases; and social/consumer ones: LiveID, Google, Twitter, FB, etc.

We offer automated on-boarding and setup, single-sign-on, a uniform and simple to use API for querying user directories, and logging and auditing.

Auth0 is offered as a service, but supports multi-modal deployments: runs in the public cloud, private cloud or as a software appliance on-premises.
